# Image Denoising and Classification model 
Final project of computer vision course 


We have used for classification from these deep models : 
<p>1- CNN
<p>2- VGG 16
<p>3- AlexNet
<p>4- ResNet 50
<p>5- Inception V3

<p>we have used Noise detection and deduction from these deep models: 
<p>1- UNet
<p>2- Autoencoder
